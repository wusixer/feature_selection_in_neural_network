# Feature selection in neural network

This repo contains code in my publication [Factors associated with opioid cessation: a machine learning approach](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/734889v1). The goal for the paper is to use different machine learning models to find a group of non-geneticc features that are the most predictive of opioid cessation.
